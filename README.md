 # Introduction

VSTS now supports its very own Wiki (preview) with a rich set of capabilities. Wiki is a great collaboration platform that will make it easy for teams to create and maintain project and process documentation in a simplified manner.

The Wiki experience hosts the following key features.

## Wiki home page
- Content pane on the left shows rich preview of a Wiki page written in [markdown](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/reference/markdown-guidance) along with the editor and edit time
